      The Scrum Team commits to achieving its goals and to supporting each
      other. Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best
      possible progress toward these goals. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders
      are open about the work and the challenges. Scrum Team members respect
      each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by
      the people with whom they work. The Scrum Team members have the courage to
      do the right thing, to work on tough problems.<br /><br />These values
      give direction to the Scrum Team with regard to their work, actions, and
      behavior. The decisions that are made, the steps taken, and the way Scrum
      is used should reinforce these values, not diminish or undermine them. The
      Scrum Team members learn and explore the values as they work with the
      Scrum events and artifacts. When these values are embodied by the Scrum
      Team and the people they work with, the empirical Scrum pillars of
      transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.
