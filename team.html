          The <u>scrum master</u> is the team role responsible for ensuring the
          team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and
          practices that the team agreed they would use.<br />
          The name was initially intended to indicate someone who is an expert
          at Scrum and can therefore coach others. The role does not generally
          have any actual authority.<br />
          People filling this role have to lead from a position of influence,
          often taking a servant-leadership stance.

          The <u>product owner</u> is a role team responsible for managing the
          product backlog in order to achieve the desired outcome that the team
          seeks to accomplish.<br /><br />
          The product owner role exists in Scrum to address challenges that
          product development teams had with multiple, conflicting direction, or
          no direction at all with respect to what to build.

          The <u>development team</u> consists of the people who deliver the
          product increment inside a Sprint. The main responsibility of the
          development team is to deliver the increment that delivers value every
          Sprint.<br /><br />
          How the work is divided up to do that is left up to the team to
          determine based on the conditions at that time.
