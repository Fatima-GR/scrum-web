      <h2 class="index-heading">What is Scrum?</h2>
      <p>
        Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby
        team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, scrum
        encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while
        working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to
        continuously improve. While the scrum I’m talking about is most
        frequently used by software development teams, its principles and
        lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the
        reasons scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project
        management framework, scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and
        roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their
        work.

      <h2 class="index-heading">When Applicable?</h2>
      <p>
        Scrum is best suited in the case where a cross functional team is
        working in a product development setting where there is a non trivial
        amount of work that lends itself to being split into more than one 2 – 4
        week iteration.<br /><br />
